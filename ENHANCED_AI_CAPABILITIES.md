# Enhanced AI Capabilities for HR Onboarding Bot

## Overview

The AI HR Assistant has been enhanced to provide comprehensive support for both **SOP-specific questions** and **general company information**. This addresses the limitation shown in the chat interface where the AI previously only had access to SOP content.

## What's New

### ðŸŽ¯ Dual Response Capability
The AI can now handle two types of questions:

1. **SOP/Policy Questions**: Uses specific content from the Employee Knowledge Base
2. **General Company Questions**: Provides helpful guidance based on common HR knowledge

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made

#### Backend (`backend/app/services/ai_connector.py`)
- Enhanced `ask_helpdesk_question()` method
- Added company information context to AI prompts
- Improved system prompts for better response handling

#### Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.jsx`)
- Updated welcome messages to reflect enhanced capabilities
- Enhanced header description
- Added new quick suggestions for company culture questions

## How It Works

### For SOP-Specific Questions
```
User: "What should I do if I forget to clock in?"
AI: [Uses provided SOP content to give specific procedure]
```

### For General Company Questions
```
User: "Tell me about company culture and values"
AI: [Provides helpful guidance based on common HR knowledge]
```

## Example Questions the AI Can Now Handle

### âœ… SOP/Policy Questions (Existing)
- "What should I do if I forget to clock in?"
- "How do I report if I'm going to be absent?"
- "What are the benefits of following attendance rules?"

### ðŸ†• General Company Questions (New)
- "Tell me about company culture and values"
- "What are the best practices for team collaboration?"
- "How can I grow professionally in this company?"
- "What is the company's approach to work-life balance?"
- "How does the company support employee development?"

## Testing the Enhanced Capabilities

### Option 1: Use the Test Script
```bash
cd backend
python test_enhanced_ai.py
```

### Option 2: Test via Frontend
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend
3. Navigate to the chat page
4. Try asking both types of questions

### Option 3: Test via API
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scope": "employee",
    "message": "Tell me about company culture and values"
  }'
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
AZURE_AI_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key
AZURE_AI_DEPLOYMENT=hr-onboarding-gpt4
```

### Dependencies
- Azure OpenAI service configured
- Backend server running on port 8000
- Frontend running on port 3000

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Employees can ask both specific and general questions
2. **Comprehensive Support**: Covers SOPs, policies, and company culture
3. **Professional Guidance**: Provides helpful HR best practices
4. **Flexible Responses**: Adapts based on question type

3. **Personalized Responses**: Tailor answers based on employee role/level
4. **Multi-language Support**: Handle questions in different languages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Not Responding to Company Questions**
   - Check if Azure AI credentials are configured
   - Verify backend is running
   - Check logs for error messages

2. **Responses Still Limited to SOP Content**
   - Ensure the enhanced `ask_helpdesk_question` method is being called
   - Check if the scope is set to "employee" for helpdesk questions

3. **Frontend Not Showing Enhanced Capabilities**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart frontend development server
   - Check if all changes are properly saved

### Debug Steps

1. Check backend logs for AI service calls
2. Verify the correct endpoint is being called (`/api/ask`)
3. Ensure the scope parameter is set correctly
4. Test the AI connector directly using the test script

## Support

If you encounter issues or have questions about the enhanced capabilities:

1. Check the backend logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Azure AI configuration
3. Test with the provided test script
4. Review the API documentation in `backend/app/api/routes.py`

**Note**: The enhanced AI capabilities require proper Azure AI configuration to function. Without valid credentials, the AI will fall back to basic responses.
