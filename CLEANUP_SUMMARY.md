### Policy Management (1 endpoint)

## üóÇÔ∏è **FILES REMOVED**

### Models
- `backend/app/models/onboarding.py` - Onboarding session models

### Services  
- `backend/app/services/onboarding_service.py` - Onboarding session management
- `backend/app/services/progress_tracker.py` - Progress tracking
- `backend/app/services/employee_kb_service.py` - Employee KB management

## üìù **FILES UPDATED**

### Backend
- `backend/app/api/routes.py` - Removed unused endpoints, simplified imports
- `backend/app/models/policy.py` - Removed unused models
- `backend/test_api.py` - Updated tests for active endpoints only
- `backend/demo_employee_helpdesk.py` - Simplified demo for active endpoints
- `backend/hr_onboarding_postman_collection.json` - Cleaned up collection

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/lib/api.js` - Removed unused endpoint definitions
- `frontend/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.jsx` - Replaced API call with mock data

## üîß **TECHNICAL CHANGES**

### Simplified Enhanced Ask Endpoint
- Changed from complex Pydantic models to simple dict handling
- Removed dependency on Employee KB service
- Simplified employee scope to use static context

### Removed Dependencies
- No more onboarding session management
- No more progress tracking
- No more employee knowledge base
- No more bulk policy ingestion

## ‚úÖ **VERIFICATION**

### Current Functionality Preserved
- ‚úÖ Employee onboarding still works
- ‚úÖ Policy management (CRUD) still works  
- ‚úÖ Policy Q&A still works
- ‚úÖ Enhanced ask endpoint still works
- ‚úÖ All frontend pages still functional

### Removed Functionality
- ‚ùå Onboarding session management (was never used)
- ‚ùå Employee knowledge base (was never used)
- ‚ùå Progress tracking (was never used)
- ‚ùå Bulk policy ingestion (was never used)

## üéØ **BENEFITS OF CLEANUP**

1. **Reduced Complexity** - Removed 13 unused endpoints
2. **Cleaner Codebase** - No more dead code or unused services
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Fewer endpoints to maintain and test
4. **Better Performance** - No unused imports or service initializations
5. **Clearer API** - Only active, functional endpoints remain
6. **Reduced Dependencies** - Removed unused service dependencies

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

The codebase is now clean and contains only the endpoints that are actually being used. All current functionality is preserved, and the system is ready for future development with a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

If you need any of the removed functionality in the future, the code can be restored from version control, but for now, the system is leaner and more focused on its core features.
